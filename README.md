# System/28
A rewrite of System/14 meant to be half as crappy. This time I am using C, C++ and Assembly. The aim is for it to reimplement all of System/14's features, (but less crappy), then work on new things.

# Progress
- [x] Basic CPU HAL (GDT, CPU functions, etc)
- [ ] PMM (take it from System/14, less crappy due to refactor?)
- [-] Interrupts
- [ ] SMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing)
- [ ] LAPIC and I/O APIC
- [ ] Heap allocation
- [ ] Timer
- [ ] Scheduling (again)
